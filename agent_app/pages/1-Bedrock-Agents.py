st.subheader("What are Bedrock Agents")

st.write("Bedrock Agent is a fully managed capability that enables developers to configure foundation models in a few clicks and complete actions (for example, processing insurance claims and making travel reservations) based on organization data and user input. Agents orchestrate interactions between foundation models, data sources, software applications, and user conversations, and automatically call APIs to take actions. Developers can easily integrate the agents and accelerate delivery of generative AI applications saving weeks of development effort")
