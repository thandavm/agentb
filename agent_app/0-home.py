st.write("Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that makes FMs from leading AI startups and Amazon available via an API, so you can choose from a wide range of FMs to find the model that's best suited for your use case. With the Bedrock serverless experience, you can get started quickly, privately customize FMs with your own data, and easily integrate and deploy them into your applications using the AWS tools and capabilities you are familiar with (including integrations with Amazon SageMaker ML features such as Experiments to test different models and Pipelines to manage your FMs at scale) without having to manage any infrastructure.")
